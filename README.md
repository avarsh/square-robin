A smart to-do list which aids productivity by suggesting tasks to work on each day.

## Installation

As the software is in very early development, no official packages have been created. However, you may clone the repo and install dependencies using ```npm install```. 

A minified version of JQuery 3.4.1 is also required under the src/resources path. Once these dependencies are satisfied, running ```electron .``` in the root directory should launch the application.

Although Square Robin is built using electron and is therefore cross platform, it has only been tested on Arch Linux.
