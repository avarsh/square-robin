# Square Robin

A smart to-do list which aids productivity by suggesting tasks to work on each day.

**Note**: This application is currently being rewritten in Typescript - see the `rewrite` branch.

## Installation

As the application is in early development, no official installer has been created, but the latest binaries can be found on the releases page. For development purposes, you may clone this repository and install dependencies using ```npm install```, and then run the application by running ```electron .``` in the root directory.

Although Square Robin is built using electron and is therefore cross platform, it has only been tested on Linux and Windows 10 systems.
